Creating a custom command is as simple as writing shell scripts.
1. Create a shell script and name the file with the command you want.
  Ex - In my_command.sh 'my_command' is what you'll type in terminal to execute the command.
2. Executing shell script requires sudo access. Use chmod
3. Once the shell script is done then copy the content of the script in a new file called 'my_command'. Dont give it any extension
4. Copy the 'my_command' file to /usr/local/bin/.Requires sudo access.
5. Use chmod in /usr/local/bin to give exexution access to 'my_command'.
6. You can now exectute the command from anywhere in the system.
